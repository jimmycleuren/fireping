# Installation

In this section we'll explain how to setup the fireping application server. Start by installing the necessary software.

## Debian

Start by adding a new package repository so that we can add the PHP7.4 binaries.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y wget gnupg ca-certificates apt-transport-https
$ wget -q https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -

$ echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list
```

Then install the necessary system dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y php7.4 php7.4-xml php7.4-fpm php7.4-mysql php7.4-mbstring php7.4-zip php7.4-curl php-rrd rrdtool git zip
```

Make sure that php7.4-fpm is up and running.

```bash
$ sudo service php7.4-fpm status
[FAIL] php-fpm7.4 is not running ... failed!
$ sudo service php7.4-fpm start
$ sudo service php7.4-fpm status
[ ok ] php-fpm7.4 is running.
```

Clone the repository to a location of your choosing.

```bash
$ mkdir /opt/fireping && cd fireping
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/jimmycleuren/fireping.git .
```

Now [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and fetch the vendor dependencies.

```bash
$ composer install --verbose --prefer-dist --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-scripts --no-suggest
```

Then, run some post-install scripts.

```bash
$ php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
$ php bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod
$ php bin/console assets:install --symlink --relative public
```

Make sure the log file is writable by the user running the webserver. The example below lists one way to do this, however note that this will make the logs readable for any user on the system.

```bash
$ sudo chmod 777 /opt/fireping/var/log/prod.log
```

# Configuration

Fireping's configuration file is called `.env.local` and is stored in the installation directory. It is not created by default.

## APP_SECRET

This is a secret key used to generate CSRF tokens. You must change it. It should be a mix of alphanumeric characters, at least 32 characters in length.

Example:

```bash
$ php -r "echo 'APP_SECRET=' . sha1(random_bytes(50)) . PHP_EOL;" | sudo tee -a .env.local
```

## DATABASE_URL

This is the connection string to connect to the database with. It is dissected as:

```bash
driver://db_user:db_password@db_host:db_port/db_name?connectionParameters
```

Example:

```bash
# Connect to a MySQL database. (driver)
# Connect as user "fireping" with password "my_secret". (db_user:db_password)
# Connect to localhost on port 3306. (db_host:db_port)
# Connect to the fireping database. (db_name)
# The database is running version 10.1. (serverVersion=10.1)
DATABASE_URL=mysql://fireping:my_secret@127.0.0.1:3306/fireping?serverVersion=10.1
```

## REDIS_URL

This is the connection string used to connect to the redis server. It must be prefixed by `redis://` or `rediss://`

Example:

```bash
# Connect to a redis server running on the localhost.
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost
```

## MAILER_URL

This is the connection string of the SMTP server to use when sending out alerts.

Example:

```bash
# Connect to an SMTP server running on localhost.
MAILER_URL=null://localhost # disable e-mail delivery.
# MAILER_URL=smtp://localhost:465?encryption=ssl&auth_mode=login&username=&password= # SMTP example.
```

## MAILER_FROM

Configure this to set the e-mail address to use when sending out alerts.

```bash
MAILER_FROM=fireping@organization.example
```

# Initial Setup

## Execute Migrations

After having installed and configured the Fireping master instance, do the following to complete your setup.

```bash
$ # in /opt/fireping
$ # execute all migrations
$ php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

                    Application Migrations


WARNING! You are about to execute a database migration that could result in schema changes and data loss. Are you sure you wish to continue? (y/n)y
$ 
```

## Create Admin User 

```bash
$ # within project root directory /opt/fireping
$ php bin/console fireping:create:user
Please enter the username (defaults to admin): admin
Please enter the password:
Please enter the email address: admin@org.example
Please choose roles for this user
  [0] ROLE_ADMIN
  [1] ROLE_API
 > 0
```

## Slave Registration
   
A slave user need to be registered with the master. This can be done via the website or via the master CLI.

### Website

Head to the admin page which can be found in the top right corner after logging in.
