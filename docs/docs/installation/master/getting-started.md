# Hardware Requirements

It depends on your needs. We started with a small server with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM and 100GB disk space. Initially, we ran all services on this: redis-server, mariadb-server, php, nginx and rrd.

As our setup grew, we grew our server to 16 GB RAM, 4 vCPUs and two storage nodes each with 1TB disks.

# Application Stack

- nginx
- php7.4
