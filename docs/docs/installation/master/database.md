# Installation

In this section we'll talk about the installation and configuration of a MariaDB database server.

This documentation was tested against a MariaDB 10.1 installation.

## Debian

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y mariadb-server
``` 

Make sure it's installed and running:

```bash
$ service mysql status
[info] MariaDB is stopped..
$ service mysql start
[ ok ] Starting MariaDB database server: mysqld.
$ service mysql status

After the installation has completed, connect to it:

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MariaDB [(none)]> 
```

Then execute the following:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE fireping;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'fireping'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'a12dd17b75817cefc00fa8d3016cdc066cfb9134';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fireping.* TO 'fireping'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]>
```

Remember the database name, user and password for later.
