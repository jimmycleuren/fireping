# How to install
You need to install a master and deploy slave nodes. 
If you want one or more slaves on the same host as the master follow the guide for [Installing master and slave(s) on the same host](/fireping/docs/getting-started/same-host). Otherwise follow the guide for [installing a master](/fireping/docs/getting-started/master) and then [deploying the slave nodes](/fireping/docs/getting-started/slaves).
