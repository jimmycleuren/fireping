## Using Docker (recommended)
You can easily [install one or more slaves using a docker image](/fireping/getting-started/slaves/docker). This has few steps and the slave is easily deployed!

## Manual
You can do a [manual installation](/fireping/getting-started/slaves/manual) but its tedious and takes a long time.
