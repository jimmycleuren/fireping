# Using Docker (Recommended)
You can easily [install one or more slaves using a docker image](/fireping/docs/getting-started/slaves/docker). This has few steps and the slave is easily deployed!

# Using ansible (Recommended for setting up multible slaves)
Ansible is a tool to autompate apps and IT infrastructures. So you can deploy a slave to all your dedicated servers/devices using it.
To do this, follow [the ansible guidelines](/docs/getting-started/slaves/deploy-with-ansible).

# Manual
You can do a [manual installation](/fireping/docs/getting-started/slaves/manual) but its tedious and takes a long time.
