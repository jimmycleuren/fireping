## Using Docker (recommended)
You can easily [install one or more slaves using a docker image](/getting-started/slaves/docker). This has few steps and has the slave up and running fast!

## Manual
If you like, you can do a [manual installation](/getting-started/slaves/manual) but its tedious and takes a long time.
