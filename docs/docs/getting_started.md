# How to install
You need to install a Master and deploy Slave nodes. If you want one or more Slaves on the same host as the Master by following the guide for [Installing Master and Slave(s) on the same host](/getting-started/same-host). Otherwise follow the guide for [installing a Master](/getting-started/master) and then [deploying the Slave nodes](/getting-started/slaves).
