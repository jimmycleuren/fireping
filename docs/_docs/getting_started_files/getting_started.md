# How to install
You need to install a Master and deploy Slave nodes. 
If you want one or more Slaves on the same host as the Master follow the guide for [Installing Master and Slave(s) on the same host](/fireping/getting-started/same-host). Otherwise follow the guide for [installing a Master](/fireping/getting-started/master) and then [deploying the Slave nodes](/fireping/getting-started/slaves).
