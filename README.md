# Fireping

Fireping is a distributed monitoring system that can keep historical graphs on network latency, network hops, website status codes, website load times and more.

We're currently working hard towards our v1.0 release. 

We created Fireping because we needed a monitoring solution that:

1. tries not to lose data
2. keeps historical data on our network health
3. does trend analysis
4. can notify different channels of alerts
